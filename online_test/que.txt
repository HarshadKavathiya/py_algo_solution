Team Work

There are a total of 2M teams in a college. There will be a total of M games played.

Teams that are paired against each other in the contest will have the same number of
players. Each player in a team plays with exactly one opposing player.

The total score for each team is calculated in the following way:

Suppose there are k players in each team. Let the two teams be team A and B.
The scores of player 0, player 1, player 2, …, player k in team A are denoted
as a0, a1, … , ak.

The scores of player 0, player 1, player 2, …, player k in team B are denoted by
b0, b1, …, bk.

As mentioned player 0 in team A plays player 0 in team B, player 1 in team A plays player 1 in team B
and so on.

The score for the teams are calculated in this way:

If ai < bi then team B is alloted a point
If ai > bi then team A is alloted a point
If ai = bi then neither team is alloted a point
So, given the scores earned by each individual players of the teams, print out the points
earned by each team.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer 2M (where M is the total number of games played; 2M
is total number of teams in the contest.)

Then for each game played, there will be 3 lines of input.
The first line contains a single integer N which is the number of players
in the two teams.

The second line contains N space separated integers which are the scores
achieved by the players of the first team.

The third line contains N space separated integers which are the scores of
achieved by the players of the second team.

Output Format

For each game played, print two space-separated integers denoting the
scores earned by the first and second team respectively.

Constraints

1 < M < 1000

1 < N < 1000

1 < Ni < 100
